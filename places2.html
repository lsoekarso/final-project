<h1>Best Places in NYC</h1>

<p><b>MASA</b><br><br>
Dining at Masa is easily one of the most extravagant and luxurious dining experiences in NYC, with a price to match. For $450, you can feast on Takayama's three-star Michilin ranked sushi, created with some of the worlds finest ingredients including foie gras and thinly shaved truffles. And Chef Masayoshi Takayama means business, as the sushi bar itself is made from a $60,000 piece of rare Japanese hinoki wood.<br><br>

Omakase: $450<br><br>

<p><b>SUSHI SEKI</b><br><br>


Sushi Seki is a local, laid-back UES restaurant serving up some of the city's best pieces of sushi. Chef Seki trained under Sushi of Gari’s Masatoshi “Gari” Sugio for 5 years, so Seki brings the same innovative creations to the Sushi Bar. Sushi Seki is also one of the only Japanese restaurants in NYC that stays open until 3AM. Late night Omakase anyone?<br><br>

Omakase: $80–$100<br><br>

<p><b>SUSHI YASUDA</b><br><br>


Since 1999, Sushi Yasuda has held its name as one of the best Omakase in NYC. Although Chef Yasuda left for Japan back in 2011, Chefs Tatsuya Sekiguchi and Mitsuru Tamura have taken over and have continued to serve some of the best quality sushi in NYC. From the chefs' knife skills to their unique and innovative pieces of sushi, this is one sushi spot that can't be beat.<br><br>

Omakase: $85-$150<br><br>

Sushi Yasuda, 204 E 43 Street, New York</p>
