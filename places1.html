<p><b>SUSHI OF GARI</b><br><br>


Masatoshi "Gari" Sugio has been serving up some of the best pieces of sushi in NYC since 1997. So, it is no surprise that Gari's tasting menu - featuring seasonal items of the day - is one of the best in the city. Though simple and laid-back in decor, the restaurant's UES flagship location continues to be the most popular. Some of Gari's famous pieces of sushi include the tuna with tofu sauce and the salmon with saut√©ed tomatoes and onions. <br><br>

Omakase: $85-$90<br><br>

<p><b>BOND ST SUSHI</b><br><br>
This East Village hotspot is equally known for its chic decor as it is for its unique and creative take on Japanese cuisine. Guests dining at Bond St can choose between the Chef's Selection starting at $40 or the full course tasting menu starting at $80.<br><br>

Omakase: $40-$120<br><br>

<p><b>SUSHI NAKAZAWA</b><br><br>


Ever since this 10-seat sushi bar opened in August, it's been pretty difficult to get a reservation, and for good reason. Chef Daisuke Nakazawa is one of Jiro's former apprentices and has brought his world-renowned techniques to NYC. Nakazawa's 20-course tasting menu eloquently demonstrates his life-long passion and knowledge of fish, redefining the way most Americans think of sushi.<br><br>

Omakase: $120 in the dining room, $150 at the sushi bar<br><br>
