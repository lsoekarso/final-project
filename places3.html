<h1>Best Places in NYC</h1>

<img src="images/12.jpg"/>
<p><b>SASABUNE</b><br><br>
If you're looking for a California Roll or a Spicy Tuna Roll, this is not the place to go. Instead, Chef Kenji Takahashi serves innovative pieces of sushi like albacore with ponzu sake sauce and monkfish liver. The 30 seat Omakase restaurant is decorated with a bamboo sushi bar and wooden tables.<br><br>

Omakase: $80<br><br>

<p><b>KURUMA ZUSHI</b><br><br>
Simple, traditional and unprecedented. Kuruma Zushi's Omakase is definitely on the higher end when it comes to prices, but Chef Toshihiro's sushi is hard to beat. Since 1977, Chef Toshihiro has been serving arguably the best pieces of traditional sushi in NYC, 12 guests at a time.<br><br>

Omakase: $250<br><br>

<p><b>15 EAST</b><br><br>
The menu at 15 East changes seasonally to ensure that only the freshest ingredients are being served all year round. In the winter, expect to see fish including the Kanburi, Ivory Salmon and Spiny Lobster on the menu. 15 East offers a couple of Omakase options, a Sushi Omakase, a Sashimi Omakase, The Tuna Flight and the Sushi and Sashimi Omakase. In addition to the Omakase, 15 East also offers a 6-course tasting menu showcasing ingredients from the land, ocean and mountains. Some of 15 East's most popular pieces of sushi include the golden-eye snapper and the Hokkaido uni.<br><br>

Omakase: $65â€“$110.<br><br>

<p><b>ICHIMURA AT BRUSHSTROKE</b><br><br>


Although Ichimura is fairly new, it has quickly established its claim to fame as one of the best Omakase options in the city. This 8-person sushi bar is nestled within David Bouley's Michilin-starred restaurant, Brushstroke, which offers a modern take on Kaiseki cuisine. Chef Ichimura was trained in Tokyo and tailors every Omakase to each individual customer while selection changes daily based on availability.<br><br>

Omakase: $160<br><br>
