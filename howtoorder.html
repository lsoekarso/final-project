<p>Normally if you go to a sushi restaurant you would see a menu and order. However, if you're having omakase the system is a little bit different. Just as we mentioned before, omakase means chef tasting menu. So basically you order omakase and the chef will pick the fish for you. The great things about omakase is that usually in fine dining restaurant, they would give you the freshest or seasonal fish of the day. <br><br>Another thing you need to know about Omakase is that there is no set price for it. Servers usually charge the pieces that the chef will give you. Usually in fine dining restaurant the price is starting from $100 per person. If you have limited budget you can also let them know, so the chef could think about the average pricing for your meal. Also another important thing is you have to let the server or the chef know about your allergy.</p>
